/**
 * AntiSpamPort - Domain Port (Interface)
 *
 * This is a port that defines what the domain needs from an anti-spam service.
 * It does NOT define HOW the service works, only WHAT it should do.
 *
 * Any adapter (mock, real, stub) must implement this interface.
 * This enables dependency injection and easy testing with doubles.
